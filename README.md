* Study the robot’s movement, which usually consists of specific steps that are repeated continuously. Divide the movement into steps and execute them alternately between the feet. For example, in the left foot, the upper joint moves, then the knee joint, then the foot.                                                                                                                                                                        * Each foot is represented by 3 servos. I determine the appropriate angles of the servo for each step.                                                                                                                                                                                              * Connecting electronic parts (servo motors)                                                                                                      - signal port in one of the digital ports.                                                                                                        - VCC port, external power supply.                                                                                                                - Gnd port is shared with the ground of the external power source and the Arduino.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * Writing the code:                                                                                                                               - Download the Arduino program                                                                                                                   - Write the code. First, call the library and find out the motors and their connection ports, then write the movement code at the appropriate angles. Since the movement of the feet is repetitive steps, functions can be written to implement the foot movement continuously and operate with a single command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Experimentation: I try out the robot’s actual movement, adjust the angles as needed, and make sure that the codes produce the desired movement correctly before I use it permanently.
